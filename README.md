# Refugee Stories

## What is Refugee Stories?
Refugee Stories is a React app that seeks to provide a platform to share the stories of refugees across the globe. Storytelling is a powerful medium in which a person can share an experience, connect with people, and provide new perspective. We've created a clean, simple platform to allow any refugee to submit their story.
